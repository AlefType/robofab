RoboFab is a Python library with objects that deal with data usually associated with fonts and type design. RoboFab has support for the UFO font format.

RoboFab is available as a couple of relatively easy to install packages. If you're just starting with RoboFab, or you just want to make UFO's, this is the place to start.

For developers and folks who like to keep their fingers on the pulse of digital type, `there is trac and svn service`_. The svn version will be more up to date and might contain new features. But you have to know how to checkout stuff from svn.
