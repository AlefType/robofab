DialogKit
=========

DialogKit is a Python library for creating GUI dialogs in FontLab and Mac OS X Cocoa applications that have a Python layer.

The library implements a subset of the (as yet unreleased) Vanilla library, which in turn was inspired by Just van Rossumâ€™s classic W library. In FontLab, dialogKit wraps the built-in GUI classes Dialog and Canvas and adds a few things along the way. The goal is to provide a simple API and consistent, or as consistent as possible, behavior between applications.
