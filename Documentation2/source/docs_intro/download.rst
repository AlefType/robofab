RoboFab, FontTools, DialogKit, Vanilla Combo
--------------------------------------------

This is a zip with RoboFab + FontTools + DialogKit + Vanilla. You might still need to install Numpy if you want to do TTX things. Otherwise, this the the trunk version of RoboFab (rev 560), the trunk version of FontTools, the trunk version of DialogKit and Vanilla. **Recommended by the Junior Woodchuck Guidebook for FontLab 5.1 on OSX 10.7.**

`All current prepackaged RoboFab distributions are here.`_

-------------------------
Download RoboFab from SVN
-------------------------

If you have svn installed and you're comfortable working with it, you might consider getting the latest revisions directly from the repository. This also gives you access to branch versions of RoboFab. Note that if you go this way rather than one of the installers, you have to take care of all the dependencies yourself.

`Trac + SVN`_

RoboFab + FontTools + Stuff for FontLab 5.0x on OSX 10.6 and earlier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Special one-click installer for RoboFab 1.2, FontTools 2.1+, DialogKit 0.1b and Numpy 1.0.4 for OSX 10.6 and earlier. This will install all dependencies **compiled for PPC**, and Python2.3.5 the way FontLab 5.0x likes it. Support for UFO2_. The ``font.info`` object has been reorganised and extended with dozens new attributes. The ``"as"`` keyword has been removed as attribute in certain methods. This installer won't work for FontLab 5.1 on 10.6 or 10.7. **This installer won't be updated.**
